    Refund & Cancellation Policy

Refund Window
We offer a full refund within the first 14 days of upgrading to any paid plan. If you’re not satisfied, simply contact us within that timeframe for a 100% refund.

Cancellation at Any Time
You can cancel your paid subscription at any time directly from your Afterflow account settings. Upon cancellation, you’ll retain access to paid features until the end of your current billing cycle, after which your account reverts to our Free tier.

No Partial Refunds After Refund Window
Beyond the initial 14-day refund period, we do not issue partial or prorated refunds. If you cancel mid-cycle, your plan remains active through the end of the billing period.

Annual Plans
For annual subscribers, the same 14-day refund window applies from the date of purchase. After that, no refunds are provided for any remaining months, but you may cancel to avoid renewal.

How to Request a Refund
If you meet the above criteria, simply email us at support@afterflow.ai or open a request via your Afterflow dashboard to initiate the refund process. Our AI-based support will confirm your eligibility and process the return to your original payment method.

Note: All refunds and cancellations adhere to local regulations and Paddle’s policies for secure payment processing.
