    <h1>Afterflow – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: March 2025</strong></p>

    <p>At Afterflow (“we,” “us,” “our”), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. By using our website, applications, and services (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to the collection and use of information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@afterflow.ai">admin@afterflow.ai</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>Account & Profile Data:</h3>
    <p>When you sign up, we collect details like your name, email address, and workspace info to manage your account.</p>

    <h3>Meeting & Transcript Data:</h3>
    <p>
      Our AI captures action items, notes, and transcripts from your recorded or uploaded meetings (via Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, etc.). 
      We use this data to provide reminders, analytics, and any features you enable.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage & Device Data:</h3>
    <p>
      We log how you access the Services (IP address, browser type, device info) to improve performance and detect issues.
    </p>

    <h3>Cookies & Similar Technologies:</h3>
    <p>
      We may use cookies to remember preferences and understand user behavior. Disabling cookies may limit certain features.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <h3>Service Provision:</h3>
    <p>We use your data to deliver meeting action items, Slack reminders, and AI-driven insights.</p>

    <h3>AI Analysis & Product Improvement:</h3>
    <p>We analyze meeting transcripts and usage patterns (often aggregated/anonymized) to refine our AI and enhance the user experience.</p>

    <h3>Communication:</h3>
    <p>We may send transactional emails (billing, updates). You can opt out of promotional emails anytime.</p>

    <h3>Security & Fraud Prevention:</h3>
    <p>We monitor usage to prevent unauthorized access or fraudulent activities.</p>

    <h3>Compliance & Legal Obligations:</h3>
    <p>We may disclose info if required by law or necessary to protect our rights or comply with legal processes.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
    <h3>Service Providers & Third Parties:</h3>
    <p>
      We rely on third-party tools (e.g., Slack, hosting, payment processors). They may access personal data only to perform tasks on our behalf, under confidentiality obligations.
    </p>

    <h3>Aggregated or De-Identified Data:</h3>
    <p>
      We may share non-identifying data for analytics, research, or improving future AI models.
    </p>

    <h3>Business Transfers:</h3>
    <p>
      In a merger or acquisition, your info may transfer. We’ll notify you if it’s subject to a different policy afterward.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention & Security</h2>
    <h3>Retention Period:</h3>
    <p>We keep data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide Services. If you cancel or request deletion, we securely remove or anonymize your data, subject to legal obligations.</p>

    <h3>Security Measures:</h3>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit/at rest). No method is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>5. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      We may process data outside your country. Where applicable, we implement safeguards (like EU Standard Contractual Clauses). 
      By using our Services, you consent to this cross-border data processing.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices & Rights</h2>
    <h3>Access & Correction:</h3>
    <p>You can review and update account info anytime. For help, email <a href="mailto:admin@afterflow.ai">admin@afterflow.ai</a>.</p>

    <h3>Marketing Preferences:</h3>
    <p>Opt out of marketing emails via the “unsubscribe” link. Transactional emails still go out (e.g. account updates).</p>

    <h3>Data Deletion:</h3>
    <p>You can request account/data deletion unless legal requirements prevent it.</p>

    <h3>Slack & Other Integrations:</h3>
    <p>Revoke Slack or other integrations at any time—though certain features may no longer function.</p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Afterflow is not intended for individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal info from children under 18. Contact us if you believe we have done so.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this periodically. We’ll notify you of material changes via email or a prominent notice. Continued use indicates acceptance.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please email <a href="mailto:admin@afterflow.ai">admin@afterflow.ai</a>.</p>
