    <h2>Afterflow – Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Last Updated: [Date]</strong></p>

<p>
At Afterflow (“we,” “us,” or “our”), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.
By using our website, applications, and services (collectively, the “Services”), you agree to the collection and use of
information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions or concerns, please contact us at 
<strong>admin@afterflow.ai</strong>.
</p>

<h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
<p><strong>Account &amp; Profile Data:</strong></p>
<p>
When you sign up, we collect basic details like your name, email address, and workspace information 
to create and manage your account.
</p>
<p><strong>Meeting &amp; Transcript Data:</strong></p>
<p>
Our AI automatically captures action items, notes, and transcripts from your uploaded or recorded meetings 
(via Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, etc.). This data may include voices, text conversations, or shared resources.
We use this information to provide action-item summaries, Slack reminders, analytics, and any other features 
you choose to enable.
</p>
<p><strong>Usage &amp; Device Data:</strong></p>
<p>
We log how you access and use the Services, including IP address, browser type, device information, and interactions 
within our dashboard or Slack integration. This helps us improve performance and detect potential issues.
</p>
<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Similar Technologies:</strong></p>
<p>
We may use cookies or similar tracking methods to remember preferences and understand user behavior. 
You can disable cookies, but some features may be limited.
</p>

<h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p><strong>Service Provision:</strong> We use your data to deliver meeting action items, Slack reminders, 
and any AI-driven insights that form our core functionality.</p>
<p><strong>AI Analysis &amp; Product Improvement:</strong> We may analyze meeting transcripts and usage patterns 
to refine our AI, identify user pain points, and improve the overall user experience. 
This analysis is typically aggregated and anonymized.</p>
<p><strong>Communication:</strong> We may send you transactional emails (e.g., billing reminders, account updates). 
For marketing or promotional emails, you can opt out anytime.</p>
<p><strong>Security &amp; Fraud Prevention:</strong> We monitor usage data to prevent unauthorized access, 
detect fraudulent activities, and maintain a safe user environment.</p>
<p><strong>Compliance &amp; Legal Obligations:</strong> We may process or disclose information if required by law 
or necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights, or resolve disputes.</p>

<h3>3. Data Sharing &amp; Disclosure</h3>
<p><strong>Service Providers &amp; Third Parties:</strong> 
We rely on third-party providers (like Slack, hosting services, payment processors) to perform certain tasks. 
They may access personal data only to provide services on our behalf and must adhere to confidentiality obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated or De-Identified Data:</strong> 
We may share aggregated or non-identifying data for analytics, research, or to improve future AI models. 
This data does not personally identify you.</p>
<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> 
In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may transfer as part of that deal. 
We’ll notify you if your data is subject to a different privacy policy afterward.</p>

<h3>4. Data Retention &amp; Security</h3>
<p><strong>Retention Period:</strong> 
We store your data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Services. 
If you cancel or request deletion, we will securely remove or anonymize your data, subject to legal 
or contractual requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Security Measures:</strong> 
We implement industry-standard safeguards (encryption in transit and at rest, secure data centers, etc.) 
to protect your information. However, no method of online transmission or storage is 100% secure, 
so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<h3>5. International Data Transfers</h3>
<p>
We may process or store data outside your home country. Where applicable, we implement safeguards (e.g., 
EU Standard Contractual Clauses) to ensure lawful data transfer. By using our Services, you consent to 
this cross-border data processing.
</p>

<h3>6. Your Choices &amp; Rights</h3>
<p><strong>Access &amp; Correction:</strong> 
You can review and update your account information at any time. If you need help accessing or correcting data, 
contact <strong>admin@afterflow.ai</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing Preferences:</strong> 
Opt out of marketing emails using the “unsubscribe” link within those messages. Transactional emails about 
your account are still sent.</p>
<p><strong>Data Deletion:</strong> 
You can request the deletion of your account and personal data. We’ll honor the request unless legal obligations 
prevent us.</p>
<p><strong>Slack &amp; Other Integrations:</strong> 
You can revoke our Slack workspace access or other integrations at any time. Doing so may limit certain features 
in Afterflow.</p>

<h3>7. Children’s Privacy</h3>
<p>
Afterflow is not designed for individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
from anyone under 18. If you believe we have collected such data, contact us to remove it.
</p>

<h3>8. Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our Services or legal obligations. 
We’ll notify you of material changes by email or a prominent notice within the Services. 
Continued use after posting indicates your acceptance of any revised terms.
