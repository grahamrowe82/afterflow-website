  <h2>3. Freemium vs. Paid: Finding the Perfect Plan for Your Team’s Needs</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>When searching for a new software tool, cost often comes first. Should you take advantage of a free plan? Or jump into a paid tier to unlock every feature? It’s a classic dilemma—especially for meeting follow-up solutions.</p>
  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <p>Pick a plan too small and you’ll be stuck with usage limits that hamper productivity mid-month. Go too big, and you might pay for bells and whistles you don’t actually need. That friction can cause analysis paralysis, delaying your start date and letting tasks slip unaddressed.</p>
  <h3>How Afterflow Helps</h3>
  <p>Afterflow’s Free Tier offers 20 monthly meetings—enough to establish a baseline habit. Once you consistently exceed that usage or need more AI-driven insights, upgrading to Plus or Pro takes seconds. Our pricing eliminates the guesswork: you’ll pay for advanced features only when you’re genuinely seeing the value. That means no wasted money and no forced leaps; the system grows as your needs grow.</p>
  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p>If you’re stuck wondering “Free or paid?”—try the free route first. You’ll know quickly if you want more. Afterflow’s built to smoothly handle that transition whenever you’re ready.</p>
