  <h2>1. Stop Dropping the Ball: The Unseen Cost of Missed Action Items</h2>
  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Ever leave a meeting feeling confident—only to realize a day later you’ve forgotten half the tasks you agreed to? It happens more often than people admit. And in the swirl of busy schedules, even small missed items can pile up into bigger problems down the road.</p>
  <h3>The Real Impact</h3>
  <p>When action items slip through the cracks, teams spend precious time repeating decisions, reassigning tasks, or apologizing to clients. Morale dips because people worry they’ll be blamed for oversights. The real kicker? Missed tasks often delay entire projects, costing far more than just embarrassment. It’s a cascading effect: one incomplete to-do today can trigger multiple headaches tomorrow.</p>
