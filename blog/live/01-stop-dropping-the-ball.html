    <h2>1. Stop Dropping the Ball: The Unseen Cost of Missed Action Items</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Ever leave a meeting feeling confident—only to realize a day later you’ve forgotten half the tasks you agreed to? It happens more often than people admit. And in the swirl of busy schedules, even small missed items can pile up into bigger problems down the road.</p>

    <h3>The Real Impact</h3>
    <p>When action items slip through the cracks, teams spend precious time repeating decisions, reassigning tasks, or apologizing to clients. Morale dips because people worry they’ll be blamed for oversights. The real kicker? Missed tasks often delay entire projects, costing far more than just embarrassment. It’s a cascading effect: one incomplete to-do today can trigger multiple headaches tomorrow.</p>

    <h3>How Afterflow Helps</h3>
    <p>Afterflow doesn’t simply transcribe your Zoom, Teams, or Meet calls—it pinpoints tasks and automatically posts them to Slack for everyone to see. There’s no frantic note-taking or rummaging through hour-long recordings later. Even on our Free Tier (20 meetings/month), you can test how a streamlined approach to capturing tasks boosts accountability. Need unlimited coverage or advanced features? Upgrade to Plus or Pro when you’re ready, ensuring no meeting or action item is ever lost again.</p>

    <h3>Take the Next Step</h3>
    <p>Missing tasks isn’t just a “little slip.” It’s the start of a domino chain that can topple entire workflows. Break that chain. Give Afterflow a try—start free—and see how quickly “lost tasks” become a thing of the past.</p>
