  <h2>5. 20 Meetings a Month: How Our Free Tier Builds a Reliable Productivity Habit</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Some free plans barely let you test the product, capping usage at a few tries. Not so with Afterflow. Our Free Tier grants you 20 meeting analyses monthly—enough to make follow-up a real habit rather than a passing experiment.</p>
  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <p>Habits form through repetition. Using a solution just a couple of times won’t reshape your team culture. Twenty monthly uses let you embed the process into your day-to-day routine. By the end of the month, you either see real value or you don’t—no guesswork.</p>
  <h3>How Afterflow Helps</h3>
  <p>Once you connect your Zoom or Teams, Afterflow automatically listens for tasks in up to 20 calls, posts them into Slack, and keeps track of completion. That’s plenty for a small team or a single department. If you do more than 20 calls or want advanced analytics, the paid tiers await. But the free plan is deliberately generous, letting you see if consistent accountability changes everything (spoiler: it does).</p>
  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
  <p>If you’ve ever felt “free tier” meant “tiny taste,” think again. Give your team a full month of consistent usage and watch how a 20-meeting limit might actually be all you need to realize this is your new normal.</p>
