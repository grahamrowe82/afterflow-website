    <h2>7. Zoom, Teams, or Meet? Unifying All Platforms Under One Workflow</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Every client or department has a favorite call platform. Your dev team might love Google Meet, while sales runs on Zoom, and management insists on Microsoft Teams. That’s convenient for them, but for you, it can feel like a swirl of chaos.</p>

    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <p>Multiple platforms mean multiple note-taking methods. Tasks can be scattered, or some might never get recorded if you skip writing them in real time. People forget to upload transcripts or cross-check references. It’s easy for tasks in one platform to vanish because the team focuses on another.</p>

    <h3>How Afterflow Helps</h3>
    <p>Afterflow seamlessly connects to Zoom, Meet, and Teams. Whether your call is with a remote contractor or an in-house sales lead, the AI captures tasks and merges them all into Slack. The free version supports up to 20 calls monthly across any of those platforms. If your usage is heavier, upgrading unlocks unlimited meeting capture—no more platform silo problems. Your entire team sees tasks centralized in Slack, bridging the gap across all these different meeting preferences.</p>

    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Let your team keep using whichever call platform they like best. You just need one system to unify and track tasks. That’s Afterflow—uncomplicate your multi-platform puzzle today.</p>
