  <h2>2. Remote Teams, Real Accountability: Leveraging AI for Seamless Meeting Follow-Up</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Working remotely is amazing—until you realize how easily tasks slip through Slack or email cracks. People in different time zones, varied schedules, and a heap of online calls can leave action items scattered across multiple chat threads.</p>
  <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
  <p>For a fully or partially remote team, missing a single deliverable can cost days of backtracking. It also erodes trust: if you rely on vague recollection, tasks go undone, leaving confusion and tension. Remote success demands absolute clarity on who owns which next steps.</p>
  <h3>How Afterflow Helps</h3>
  <p>By automatically joining your Zoom or Meet calls, Afterflow identifies tasks the moment they’re mentioned. It then syncs them to Slack, tagging who’s responsible.

But if you find remote calls are piling up, the Plus or Pro options let you scale without limits—ensuring no matter how global your team is, tasks remain crystal-clear.</p>
  <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
