## 13. Slack Over Email: The Simple Reason Timely Reminders Make All the Difference

**Introduction**  
Email remains a staple of modern work, but it can also be painfully slow for urgent next steps. Meanwhile, Slack messages are seen much sooner, guaranteeing faster responses. If your tasks only land in email, you’re surrendering to potential delays.

**Why It Matters**  
Timely follow-through is gold for any project. Email might bury your request beneath newsletters, client pings, or random subscription blasts. By the time a user sees it, hours or days might pass. Slack, on the other hand, is more immediate—keeping tasks alive in a channel or direct mention that everyone checks multiple times a day.

**How Afterflow Helps**  
Because Afterflow posts tasks straight into Slack, you don’t rely on memory or a messy email chain. The AI identifies to-dos mid-call, then pings your channel instantly. If your team meets less than 20 times monthly, the free tier covers you. For heavier usage or deeper analytics, the paid levels ensure unlimited coverage. But in either case, Slack-based reminders are consistently visible, making tasks just about impossible to ignore.

**Final Thoughts**  
Don’t let tasks vanish in email’s black hole. Move your action items where immediate attention is guaranteed—Slack. Afterflow’s real-time approach means tasks get done, not snoozed.
