## 11. Not Just Summaries: Turning AI-Identified Tasks into Real Outcomes

**Introduction**  
Transcripts by themselves rarely spark action. Even if your team receives a neatly typed record, it won’t matter unless tasks are singled out and assigned. Summaries can help, but do they funnel directly into day-to-day accountability?

**Why It Matters**  
Teams drown in meeting recaps with no direct link to execution. People re-check or highlight phrases manually, occasionally missing the real to-do item. This mismatch leads to the dreaded “We had it written somewhere, but guess we forgot,” scenario. Over time, that’s wasted hours and missed deadlines.

**How Afterflow Helps**  
Afterflow specifically targets tasks, not just text. Our AI listens for phrases like “We should…” or “Let’s do…,” then assigns owners and deadlines. By funneling those items into Slack, your team always sees them in a place they actively use. If you only need 20 monthly calls, the free plan is plenty. For bigger volumes or advanced insights (like measuring how many tasks close each week), choose Plus or Pro.

**Final Thoughts**  
Skip the static transcripts that gather dust. Move to an AI engine that transforms conversation into active tasks. Start free, and see how bridging meeting talk with real outcomes changes your team dynamic entirely.
