## 4. Slack or Bust: Why Real-Time Task Reminders Trump Email

**Introduction**  
We’ve all lost tasks in cluttered email inboxes. People vow to circle back, but time marches on—and the message buries itself under newsletters and random updates. Meanwhile, Slack is a real-time environment where everyone sees quick pings.

**Why It Matters**  
When tasks are slow to surface, deadlines slip. Think about it: if you rely on email follow-ups, it could be hours or days before the recipient even sees your message. In Slack, they’re likely to see it within minutes. For a fast-paced team, that difference changes everything.
