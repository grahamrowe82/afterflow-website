## 14. Taming Meeting Anxiety: AI That Frees You From Memory Overload

**Introduction**  
Worried about forgetting details in a jam-packed day of calls? Meeting anxiety often stems from the fear of losing track of crucial tasks. If you’re mentally juggling bullet points, you can’t fully engage in the conversation.

**Why It Matters**  
This stress not only harms personal well-being but also drains cognitive energy that could be better spent brainstorming or negotiating. People might zone out in the latter half of a meeting just to safeguard the first half’s tasks in their head.

**How Afterflow Helps**  
Afterflow eliminates that memory load by automatically identifying, logging, and reminding you of each to-do. Even the free version—covering up to 20 monthly meetings—is enough to show you how easy it is to trust an AI system. That trust dissolves the anxiety. For deeper coverage or advanced analytics (like noticing a recurring point you’re anxious about), the paid plans step in. But the immediate relief from “Will I remember this?” is enormous.

**Final Thoughts**  
You shouldn’t have to stress about memory when collaborating. Let AI carry the mental load, so you can focus on creative thinking. Try the free tier and see if your meeting anxiety fades away as quickly as the undone tasks do.
