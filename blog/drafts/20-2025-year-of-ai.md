## 20. Why 2025 is the Year of AI Meeting Solutions: Staying Ahead of the Curve

**Introduction**  
AI meeting solutions are no longer fringe. By 2025, they’ll be mainstream—helping companies large and small handle accountability, insight, and quick decision-making. Early adopters will have a head start, forging efficient routines while competitors scramble to catch up.

**Why It Matters**  
If you wait until “everyone else is using it,” you miss the first-mover advantage. That advantage can manifest in hitting product milestones faster, impressing clients with flawless follow-up, or simply standing out in a crowded market as a team that always delivers.
