## 16. Show Me the Numbers: A Straight Comparison of Afterflow vs. Competitors

**Introduction**  
How does Afterflow stack up versus Otter.ai, Fireflies, or other known players? It’s a common question: do we truly offer a better free experience or more seamless Slack integration?

**Why It Matters**  
Choosing the wrong platform could lead you into hidden caps, forced upgrades, or missing Slack integration. No one wants to discover half the features are locked at the moment they need them most.

**How Afterflow Helps**  
Our free plan is distinctly generous—20 monthly meetings plus Slack reminders at no cost. Competitors often impose stricter transcription minutes or block Slack integration behind mid-tier plans. Meanwhile, our paid tiers remain straightforward, scaling from unlimited coverage (Plus) to advanced AI insights (Pro). Rather than burying advanced functions behind multiple add-ons, we keep them in a single plan for serious users.

**Final Thoughts**  
If you want raw numbers: Afterflow’s free tier usage typically exceeds what other free plans offer, especially for real Slack synergy. Check out the details on our Pricing page or try it directly. The difference will show up in your daily workflow.
