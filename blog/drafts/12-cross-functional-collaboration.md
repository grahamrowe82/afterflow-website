## 12. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Five Surprising Ways AI Summaries Elevate Teamwork

**Introduction**  
When your call includes marketing, dev, and sales, each side hears tasks differently. If a single point gets lost in translation, you waste half a meeting re-clarifying. Cross-functional synergy depends heavily on a shared, transparent task list.

**Why It Matters**  
Imagine a dev team that “didn’t realize” marketing needed a new landing page until right before launch. Or a sales team that never followed up on leads because engineering updates were incomplete. These small cracks in coordination become major delays.

**How Afterflow Helps**  
Afterflow eliminates guesswork. Regardless of each side’s lingo, the AI flags tasks specifically for whomever is responsible. Slack posts show each department’s to-dos side by side. The free tier suffices if you have limited cross-department calls. But once you realize how beneficial full coverage is, upgrading ensures no meeting goes untracked. The synergy is surprising: marketing sees engineering tasks, dev sees sales follow-ups—everyone syncs in one environment.

**Final Thoughts**  
Cross-functional brilliance starts with crystal-clear accountability. Use Afterflow to unify your team’s tasks in Slack, bridging the gap between specialties and stopping those miscommunication slip-ups cold.
